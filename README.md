# Individual Project

**INF4051**

The project works as intended with all the functions working, and a bit of additional functions also (very small, only details update). The only thing not working is the taskServiceTest.java that I couldn't manage to make it work. 

# To launch the program

Just go to the root file and launch the software

# To launch the TaskControllerTest.java & taskServiceTest.java tests

You can use both the command : `./mvnw test` in the root folder, OR you can directly go to the desired file in the project in IntelliJ and click "launch" while being in "Current file". The tests use `Maven`

# Any questions?

good luck haha
